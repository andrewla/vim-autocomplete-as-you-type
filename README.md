# Vim Autocomplete-As-You-Type

Autocomplete-as-you-type pruned down to the absolute minimum.

Uses omnifunc for autocomplete. Supports tab to switch highlighted items, and
enter to select.  If nothing is selected, then enter just inserts a CR. If you
are on a blank line, then tab will insert a tab.

You are responsible for providing an omnifunc that does what you want to do.
